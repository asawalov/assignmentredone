# assignmentredone

I started this assignment again and made a own user (previously i used of django) and used in the assignment. In this i made three user_types doctor,nurse and surgeon.
Doctor will have access to all database and create, update and delete any database.
Nurse will have access to database but can'nt delete the database.
Surgeon will have access to update feature in which they can only update the surgery field whether is done/pending.

I was using dbsqlite before but now i have also changed that to postgres.
After this i will be studying rest framework .

Issues - I was not able to make things dynamic here as i have created seperarte functions of create for nurse/surgeon/doctor . I am exploring this things as of now.
